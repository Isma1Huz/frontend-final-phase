#RECIPE-ROOM APP (GROUP-4 PROJECT)
Recipe Room is a dynamic and user-friendly React web application that empowers users to explore a diverse collection of recipes while also providing them with the creative space to contribute their own culinary masterpieces. Whether you're looking for inspiration in the kitchen or eager to share your signature dishes, Recipe Room is your go-to platform for all things culinary.

#Problem Statement:
Many existing platforms lack the seamless integration of viewing and contributing recipes, leading to a fragmented user experience. This presents an opportunity for a React-based recipe app to address these pain points, offering users a cohesive platform that simplifies the process of exploring diverse recipes while fostering a collaborative community for sharing and creating culinary delights
